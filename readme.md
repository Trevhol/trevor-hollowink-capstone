Hi Andrii
Welcome to My Home Room

IMPORTANT: desktop res 1440. MY BOARD, MY CLASSROOM and MY CLASS are protected routes so you need to be logged in to see them!
I used multer for my file upload system, when you have no local storage it will give you an error because of my login functionality, the error doesnt
prevent anything you can just register with a new user or login.I didnt expand more on this login functionality because down the road
I plan switch to Oauth. you can register with a new user. or sign in with username: Trevor password: test . please view my file on 1440 resolution, it has been made for 
desktop only. when a student uploads their file is uploaded to their my Board page, it is saved in the data.json and public/ uploads/student folder. 
 Things to add for the next week Oauth, seperate login functionality for students and teacher, rendering of PDF files rather then just a pdf image appearing.
